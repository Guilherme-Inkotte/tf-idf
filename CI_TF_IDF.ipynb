computers and human language in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data  ', 'The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents including the contextual nuances of the language within them', 'The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves', 'Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition naturallanguage understanding and naturallanguage generation', 'Contents', 'Historyedit', 'Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s', 'Already in 1950 Alan Turing published an article titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence', 'The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language', 'Symbolic NLP 1950s – early 1990sedit', 'The premise of symbolic NLP is wellsummarized by John Searles Chinese room experiment Given a collection of rules eg a Chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other NLP tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts', 'Statistical NLP 1990s–2010sedit', 'Up to the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules  ', 'Starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing  ', 'This was due to both the steady increase in computational power see Moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics eg transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing6', 'Neural NLP presentedit', 'In the 2010s representation learning and deep neural networkstyle machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing', 'That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques78 can achieve stateoftheart results in many natural language tasks eg in language modeling9 and parsing1011', 'This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care12', 'Methods Rules statistics neural networksedit', 'In the early days many languageprocessing systems were designed by symbolic methods ie the handcoding of a set of rules coupled with a dictionary lookup1314 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming', 'More recent systems based on machinelearning algorithms have many advantages over handproduced rules', 'Despite the popularity of machine learning in NLP research symbolic methods are still 2020 commonly used', 'Statistical methodsedit', 'Since the socalled statistical revolution1516 in the late 1980s and mid1990s much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning', 'The machinelearning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora the plural form of corpus is a set of documents possibly with human or computer annotations of typical realworld examples', 'Many different classes of machinelearning algorithms have been applied to naturallanguageprocessing tasks', 'These algorithms take as input a large set of features that are generated from the input data', 'Increasingly however research has focused on statistical models which make soft probabilistic decisions based on attaching realvalued weights to each input feature complexvalued embeddings17 and neural networks in general have also been proposed for eg speech18', 'Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system', 'Some of the earliestused machine learning algorithms such as decision trees produced systems of hard ifthen rules similar to existing handwritten rules  ', 'However partofspeech tagging introduced the use of hidden Markov models to natural language processing and increasingly research has focused on statistical models which make soft probabilistic decisions based on attaching realvalued weights to the features making up the input data', 'The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models  ', 'Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input especially input that contains errors as is very common for realworld data and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks', 'Since the neural turn statistical methods in NLP research have been largely replaced by neural networks', 'However they continue to be relevant for contexts in which statistical interpretability and transparency is required', 'Neural networksedit', 'A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering', 'Since 201519 the field has thus largely abandoned statistical methods and shifted to neural networks for machine learning', 'Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words and an increase in endtoend learning of a higherlevel task eg question answering instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing', 'In some areas this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed such that deep neural networkbased approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing', 'For instance the term neural machine translation NMT emphasizes the fact that deep learningbased approaches to machine translation directly learn sequencetosequence transformations obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that was used in statistical machine translation SMT', 'Common NLP tasksedit', 'The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing', 'Some of these

of the longstanding series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed38', 'Cognition and NLPedit', 'Most higherlevel NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language', 'More broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above', 'Cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses39', ' Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes40 Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics41 Especially during the age of symbolic NLP the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies', 'As an example George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing NLP algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics42 with two defining aspects', 'Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s', 'Nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks eg of cognitive grammar44 functional grammar45 construction grammar46 computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience eg ACTR however with limited uptake in mainstream NLP as measured by presence on major conferences47 of the ACL', 'More recently ideas of

that follows voice commands or answers spoken questions', 'What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talk—quickly slurring words together with varying emphasis and intonation in different accents and often using incorrect grammar', 'Part of speech tagging also called grammatical tagging is the process of determining the part of speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context', 'Part of speech identifies ‘make’ as a verb in ‘I can make a paper plane’ and as a noun in ‘What make of car do you own’', 'Word sense disambiguation is

with semantic cues such as words signs or images', 'It’s been said that language is easier to learn and comes more naturally in adolescence because it’s a repeatable trained behavior—much like walking', 'And language doesn’t follow a strict set of rules with so many exceptions like “I before E except after C” What comes naturally to humans however is exceedingly difficult for computers with the amount of unstructured data lack of formal rules and absence of realworld context or intent', 'That’s why machine learning and artificial intelligence AI are gaining attention and momentum with greater human dependency on computing systems to communicate and perform tasks', 'And as AI and augmented analytics get\\xa0more sophisticated so will Natural Language Processing NLP', 'While the terms AI and NLP might conjure images of futuristic robots there are already basic examples of NLP at work in our daily lives', 'Here are a few prominent examples', 'Email filters', 'Email filters are one of the most basic and initial applications of NLP online', 'It started out with spam filters uncovering certain words or phrases that signal a spam message', 'But filtering has upgraded just like early adaptations of NLP', 'One of the more prevalent newer applications of NLP is found in Gmails email classification', 'The system recognizes if emails belong in one of three categories primary social or promotions based on their contents', 'For all Gmail users this keeps your inbox to a manageable size with important relevant emails you wish to review and respond to quickly', 'Smart assistants', 'Smart assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s', 'Alexa recognize patterns in speech thanks to voice recognition then infer meaning and provide a useful response', 'We’ve become used to the fact that we can say “Hey Siri” ask a question and she understands what we said and responds with relevant answers based on context', 'And we’re getting used to seeing Siri or Alexa pop up throughout our home and daily life as we have conversations with them through items like the thermostat light switches car and more', 'We now expect assistants like Alexa and Siri to understand contextual clues as they improve our lives and make certain activities easier like ordering items and even appreciate when they respond humorously or answer questions about themselves', 'Our interactions will grow more personal as these assistants get to know more about us', 'As a New York Times article “Why We May Soon Be Living in Alexa’s World” explained “Something bigger is afoot', 'Alexa has the best shot of becoming the third great consumer computing platform of this decade”', 'Search results', 'Search engines use NLP to surface relevant results based on similar search behaviors or user intent so the average person finds what they need without being a searchterm wizard', 'For example Google not only predicts what popular searches may apply to your query as you start typing but it looks at the whole picture and recognizes what you’re trying to say rather than the exact search words', 'Someone could put a flight number in Google and get the flight status type a

            "['Towards Data Science', 'Jan 15 2019', 'Save', 'Your Guide to Natural Language Processing NLP', 'How machines process and understand human language', 'Everything we express either verbally or in written carries huge amounts of information', 'The topic we choose our tone our selection of words everything adds some type of information that can be interpreted and value extracted from it', 'In theory we can understand and even predict human behaviour using that information', 'But there is a problem one person may generate hundreds or thousands of words in a declaration each sentence with its corresponding complexity', 'If you want to scale and analyze several hundreds thousands or millions of people or declarations in a given geography then the situation is unmanageable', 'Data generated from conversations declarations or even tweets are examples of unstructured data', 'Unstructured data doesn’t fit neatly into the traditional row and column structure of relational databases and represent the vast majority of data available in the actual world', 'It is messy and hard to manipulate', 'Nevertheless thanks to the advances in disciplines like machine learning a big revolution is going on regarding this topic', 'Nowadays it is no longer about trying to interpret a text or speech based on its keywords the old fashioned mechanical way but about understanding the meaning behind those words the cognitive way', 'This way it is possible to detect figures of speech like irony or even perform sentiment analysis', 'Natural Language Processing or NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read understand and derive meaning from human languages', 'It is a discipline that focuses on the interaction between data science and human language and is scaling to lots of industries', 'Today NLP is booming thanks to the huge improvements in the access to data and the increase in computational power which are allowing practitioners to achieve meaningful results in areas like healthcare media finance and human resources among others', 'Use Cases of NLP', 'In simple terms NLP represents the automatic handling of natural human language like speech or text and although the concept itself is fascinating the real value behind this technology comes from the use cases', 'NLP can help you with lots of tasks and the fields of application just seem to increase on a daily basis', 'Let’s mention some examples', 'NLP enables the recognition and prediction of diseases based on electronic health records and patient’s own speech', 'This capability is being explored in health conditions that go from cardiovascular diseases to depression and even schizophrenia', 'For example Amazon Comprehend Medical is a service that uses NLP to extract disease conditions medications and treatment outcomes from patient notes clinical trial reports and other electronic health records', 'Organizations can determine what customers are saying about a service or product by identifying and extracting information in sources like social media', 'This sentiment analysis can provide a lot of information about customers choices and their decision drivers', 'An inventor at IBM developed a cognitive assistant that works like a personalized search engine by learning all about you and then remind you of a name a song or anything you can’t remember the moment you need it to', 'Companies like Yahoo and Google filter and classify your emails with NLP by analyzing text in emails that flow through their servers and stopping spam before they even enter your inbox', 'To help identifying fake news the NLP Group at MIT developed a new system to determine if a source is accurate or politically biased detecting if a news source can be trusted or not', 'Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri are examples of intelligent voice driven interfaces that use NLP to respond to vocal prompts and do everything like find a particular shop tell us the weather forecast suggest the best route to the office or turn on the lights at home', 'Having an insight into what is happening and what people are talking about can be very valuable to financial traders', 'NLP is being used to track news reports comments about possible mergers between companies everything can be then incorporated into a trading algorithm to generate massive profits', 'Remember buy the rumor sell the news', 'NLP is also being used in both the search and selection phases of talent recruitment identifying the skills of potential hires and also spotting prospects before they become active on the job market', 'Powered by IBM Watson NLP technology LegalMation developed a platform to automate routine litigation tasks and help legal teams save time drive down costs and shift strategic focus', 'NLP is particularly booming in the healthcare industry', 'This technology is improving care delivery disease diagnosis and bringing costs down while healthcare organizations are going through a growing adoption of electronic health records', 'The fact that clinical documentation can be improved means that patients can be better understood and benefited through better healthcare', 'The goal should be to optimize their experience and several organizations are already working on this', 'Companies like Winterlight Labs are making huge improvements in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease by monitoring cognitive impairment through speech and they can also support clinical trials and studies for a wide range of central nervous system disorders', 'Following a similar approach Stanford University developed Woebot a chatbot therapist with the aim of helping people with anxiety and other disorders', 'But serious controversy is around the subject', 'A couple of years ago Microsoft demonstrated that by analyzing large samples of search engine queries they could identify internet users who were suffering from pancreatic cancer even before they have received a diagnosis of the disease', 'How would users react to such diagnosis', 'And what would happen if you were tested as a false positive', 'meaning that you can be diagnosed with the disease even though you don’t have it', 'This recalls the case of Google Flu Trends which in 2009 was announced as being able to predict influenza but later on vanished due to its low accuracy and inability to meet its projected rates', 'NLP may be the key to an effective clinical support in the future but there are still many challenges to face in the short term', 'Basic NLP to impress your nonNLP friends', 'The main drawbacks we face these days with NLP relate to the fact that language is very tricky', 'The process of understanding and manipulating language is extremely complex and for this reason it is common to use different techniques to handle different challenges before binding everything together', 'Programming languages like Python or R are highly used to perform these techniques but before diving into code lines that will be the topic of a different article it’s important to understand the concepts beneath them', 'Let’s summarize and explain some of the most frequently used algorithms in NLP when defining the vocabulary of terms', 'Bag of Words', 'Is a commonly used model that allows you to count all words in a piece of text', 'Basically it creates an occurrence matrix for the sentence or document disregarding grammar and word order', 'These word frequencies or occurrences are then used as features for training a classifier', 'To bring a short example I took the first sentence of the song “Across the Universe” from The Beatles', 'Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup', 'They slither while they pass they slip away across the universe', 'Now let’s count the words', 'This approach may reflect several downsides like the absence of semantic meaning and context and the facts that stop words like “the” or “a” add noise to the analysis and some words are not weighted accordingly “universe” weights less than the word “they”', 'To solve this problem one approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all texts not just the one we are analyzing so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across other texts get penalized', 'This approach to scoring is called “Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency” TFIDF and improves the bag of words by weights', 'Through TFIDF frequent terms in the text are “rewarded” like the word “they” in our example but they also get “punished” if those terms are frequent in other texts we include in the algorithm too', 'On the contrary this method highlights and “rewards” unique or rare terms considering all texts', 'Nevertheless this approach still has no context nor semantics', 'Tokenization', 'Is the process of segmenting running text into sentences and words', 'In essence it’s the task of cutting a text into pieces called tokens and at the same time throwing away certain characters such as punctuation', 'Following our example the result of tokenization would be', 'Pretty simple right', 'Well although it may seem quite basic in this case and also in languages like English that separate words by a blank space called segmented languages not all languages behave the same and if you think about it blank spaces alone are not sufficient enough even for English to perform proper tokenizations', 'Splitting on blank spaces may break up what should be considered as one token as in the case of certain names eg San Francisco or New York or borrowed foreign phrases eg laissez faire', 'Tokenization can remove punctuation too easing the path to a proper word segmentation but also triggering possible complications', 'In the case of periods that follow abbreviation eg dr the period following that abbreviation should be considered as part of the same token and not be removed', 'The tokenization process can be particularly problematic when dealing with biomedical text domains which contain lots of hyphens parentheses and other punctuation marks', 'For deeper details on tokenization you can find a great explanation in this article', 'Stop Words Removal', 'Includes getting rid of common language articles pronouns and prepositions such as “and” “the” or “to” in English', 'In this process some very common words that appear to provide little or no value to the NLP objective are filtered and excluded from the text to be processed hence removing widespread and frequent terms that are not informative about the corresponding text', 'Stop words can be safely ignored by carrying out a lookup in a predefined list of keywords freeing up database space and improving processing time', 'There is no universal list of stop words', 'These can be preselected or built from scratch', 'A potential approach is to begin by adopting predefined stop words and add words to the list later on', 'Nevertheless it seems that the general trend over the past time has been to go from the use of large standard stop word lists to the use of no lists at all', 'The thing is stop words removal can wipe out relevant information and modify the context in a given sentence', 'For example if we are performing a sentiment analysis we might throw our algorithm off track if we remove a stop word like “not”', 'Under these conditions you might select a minimal stop word list and add additional terms depending on your specific objective', 'Stemming', 'Refers to the process of slicing the end or the beginning of words with the intention of removing affixes lexical additions to the root of the word', 'Affixes that are attached at the beginning of the word are called prefixes eg “astro” in the word “astrobiology” and the ones attached at the end of the word are called suffixes eg “ful” in the word “helpful”', 'The problem is that affixes can create or expand new forms of the same word called inflectional affixes or even create new words themselves called derivational affixes', 'In English prefixes are always derivational the affix creates a new word as in the example of the prefix “eco” in the word “ecosystem” but suffixes can be derivational the affix creates a new word as in the example of the suffix “ist” in the word “guitarist” or inflectional the affix creates a new form of word as in the example of the suffix “er” in the word “faster”', 'Ok so how can we tell the difference and chop the right bit', 'A possible approach is to consider a list of common affixes and rules Python and R languages have different libraries containing affixes and methods and perform stemming based on them but of course this approach presents limitations', 'Since stemmers use algorithmics approaches the result of the stemming process may not be an actual word or even change the word and sentence meaning', 'To offset this effect you can edit those predefined methods by adding or removing affixes and rules but you must consider that you might be improving the performance in one area while producing a degradation in another one', 'Always look at the whole picture and test your model’s performance', 'So if stemming has serious limitations why do we use it', 'First of all it can be used to correct spelling errors from the tokens', 'Stemmers are simple to use and run very fast they perform simple operations on a string and if speed and performance are important in the NLP model then stemming is certainly the way to go', 'Remember we use it with the objective of improving our performance not as a grammar exercise', 'Lemmatization', 'Has the objective of reducing a word to its base form and grouping together different forms of the same word', 'For example verbs in past tense are changed into present eg “went” is changed to “go” and synonyms are unified eg “best” is changed to “good” hence standardizing words with similar meaning to their root', 'Although it seems closely related to the stemming process lemmatization uses a different approach to reach the root forms of words', 'Lemmatization resolves words to their dictionary form known as lemma for which it requires detailed dictionaries in which the algorithm can look into and link words to their corresponding lemmas', 'For example the words “running” “runs” and “ran” are all forms of the word “run” so “run” is the lemma of all the previous words', 'Lemmatization also takes into consideration the context of the word in order to solve other problems like disambiguation which means it can discriminate between identical words that have different meanings depending on the specific context', 'Think about words like “bat” which can correspond to the animal or to the metalwooden club used in baseball or “bank” corresponding to the financial institution or to the land alongside a body of water', 'By providing a partofspeech parameter to a word  whether it is a noun a verb and so on it’s possible to define a role for that word in the sentence and remove disambiguation', 'As you might already pictured lemmatization is a much more resourceintensive task than performing a stemming process', 'At the same time since it requires more knowledge about the language structure than a stemming approach it demands more computational power than setting up or adapting a stemming algorithm', 'Topic Modeling', 'Is as a method for uncovering hidden structures in sets of texts or documents', 'In essence it clusters texts to discover latent topics based on their contents processing individual words and assigning them values based on their distribution', 'This technique is based on the assumptions that each document consists of a mixture of topics and that each topic consists of a set of words which means that if we can spot these hidden topics we can unlock the meaning of our texts', 'From the universe of topic modelling techniques Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA is probably the most commonly used', 'This relatively new algorithm invented less than 20 years ago works as an unsupervised learning method that discovers different topics underlying a collection of documents', 'In unsupervised learning methods like this one there is no output variable to guide the learning process and data is explored by algorithms to find patterns', 'To be more specific LDA finds groups of related words by', 'Assigning each word to a random topic where the user defines the number of topics it wishes to uncover', 'You don’t define the topics themselves you define just the number of topics and the algorithm will map all documents to the topics in a way that words in each document are mostly captured by those imaginary topics', 'The algorithm goes through each word iteratively and reassigns the word to a topic taking into considerations the probability that the word belongs to a topic and the probability that the document will be generated by a topic', 'These probabilities are calculated multiple times until the convergence of the algorithm', 'Unlike other clustering algorithms like Kmeans that perform hard clustering where topics are disjointed LDA assigns each document to a mixture of topics which means that each document can be described by one or more topics eg Document 1 is described by 70 of topic A 20 of topic B and 10 of topic C and reflect more realistic results', 'Topic modeling is extremely useful for classifying texts building recommender systems eg to recommend you books based on your past readings or even detecting trends in online publications', 'How does the future look like', 'At the moment NLP is battling to detect nuances in language meaning whether due to lack of context spelling errors or dialectal differences', 'On March 2016 Microsoft launched Tay an Artificial Intelligence AI chatbot released on Twitter as a NLP experiment', 'The idea was that as more users conversed with Tay the smarter it would get', 'Well the result was that after 16 hours Tay had to be removed due to its racist and abusive comments', 'Microsoft learnt from its own experience and some months later released Zo its second generation Englishlanguage chatbot that won’t be caught making the same mistakes as its predecessor', 'Zo uses a combination of innovative approaches to recognize and generate conversation and other companies are exploring with bots that can remember details specific to an individual conversation', 'Although the future looks extremely challenging and full of threats for NLP the discipline is developing at a very fast pace probably like never before and we are likely to reach a level of advancement in the coming years that will make complex applications look possible', 'Thanks Jesús del Valle  Jannis Busch and Sabrina
